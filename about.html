          <h2>Family Bios</h2>
          <h3 class="col-sm-3">Master Michael</h3>
          <p class="col-sm-9">
            Michael is a natural Dominant. He was one of the kids on the
            playground that always decided what game(s) were going to be played
            and chose the teams. As he grew up he learned about BDSM in his
            teenage years and then as soon as he reached college at 18 he
            started actively practicing BDSM activities. Since there was no
            internet as we know it in the 1980's and no local BDSM groups in his
            area his initial BDSM activities were self taught. After he finished
            college and enlisted into the military he was able to start finding
            local BDSM groups and others with more experience in the lifestyle
            to mentor and educate him in SSC/RACK BDSM play. Master Michael has
            expanded his experiences to include making custom BDSM toys with
            paracord. You can see some of his work on the
            <a href="shopping.html" alt="House of Zevha shopping page"
              >shopping page</a
            >a and reach out to him for a custom collar, set of cuffs, flogger,
            or single-tail whip. While he will be the first one to tell you that
            he is still learning he does enjoy teaching the younger generation
            now as they come up, passing along the knowledge that has been
            shared with him.
          </p>
          <h3>Mistress Kitten</h3>
          <p>
            Kitten also developed an interest in BDSM many years ago, while in
            the military although she didn't know exactly what it was called at
            the time. She knew that she both enjoyed inflicting pain on others
            and receiving pain herself and after finding a BDSM group learned
            about consensual lifestyle activities. As soon as she found her
            first local group she started learning and training, absorbing
            everything she could. She started her relationship with Master
            Michael by serving a year as his full-time 24/7 submissive before
            assuming a Dominant role. She still serves as a submissive to Master
            Michael while assuming a Dominant role with all others and will
            freely admit that she isn't always a very good submissive.
          </p>
          <h3>bunny</h3>
          <p>
            bunny was the first 24/7 collared submissive of Master Michael &
            Mistress Kitten under a permanent, lifetime contract on 22 March
            2014. bunny found the lifestyle later in life than either Master
            Michael or Mistress Kitten, however, has jumped in with both feet
            and is embracing her new world. As bunny has grown and evolved over
            the last several years, while maintaining her primary role as a
            submissive she has also learned that there is a "baby Sadist" inside
            her as she likes to call it.
          </p>
          <h3>House of Zevha</h3>
          <p>
            Master Michael and Mistress Kitten met and were married, collared,
            and handfasted in 2000. Master Michael and Mistress Kitten initially
            joined the House of Kane in early 2001 after meeting Master Daniel
            Kane at Menages, a swingers club in Nashville, Tn where they did
            fetish demos and training. Shortly after joining the House of Kane,
            <em>Gatherings (Rose n Thorns)</em> -A local fetish group and play
            space- closed and they decided to form Middle TN Dungeon Society
            (MTDS). Middle TN Dungeon Society (MTDS) was run for several years
            by Master Michael & Mistress Kitten since Master Daniel was still
            active duty military and was stationed out of the state. After
            several years of spending every weekend running MTDS another local
            club, The Mark, opened and Master Michael & Mistress Kitten decided
            to close MTDS to regain some of their life back and allow more time
            for just enjoying the lifestyle themselves. Eventually Master Daniel
            did return to the Nashville area and reconnected with Master Michael
            and Mistress Kitten. As the family started to grow with more
            Dominants and submissives/slaves joining the family it became
            apparent there were some philosophical differences in protocol and
            training that were causing a rift in the family dynamic. Due to
            these differences it was with much thought and sadness that Master
            Michael and Mistress Kitten felt it best to leave the Kane family
            and start their own leather family moving forward. The House of
            Zevha was born based on this decision 18 April 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the passing of Master Daniel Kane on 06 July 2014 Delmar Kane
            became the leader of the Kane family and on 27 October 2014 the
            House of Zevha formally entered into a family alliance with the
            House of Kane. While still maintaining some philosophical
            differences the two families did share a united focus in advancing
            the lifestyle in the Greater Middle Tn area and educating new
            people. Both families felt that forming an alliance helped both
            leather families achieve that goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early 2015 the Kane family for all intents and purposes disolved
            due to internal strife along with posers in the BDSM community using
            the Kane name without permission for personal gain. Delmar Samil
            (foremerly Kane) who had assumed leadership of the House of Kane
            made this decision with a heavy heart and formed his own house under
            his new leather name, Samil. The House of Zehva maintains a close
            friendship with Delmar and his leather family as Master Michael was
            involved in some of the early training and development of Delmar as
            a Dominant.
